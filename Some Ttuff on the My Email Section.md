## **What is it?**

The "My Email" system on the college portal is a link to your Outlook email which is connected to your college. The college creates an email for you to use within their systems and send emails to other students and staff when necessary. This email is monitored at all times and will alert any staff when there is a problem that could cause other issues or is classed as innapropriate. It is advised and expected by the college that you only use it for work progress or communication purposes between students and staff about your course or the work you are doing related to it.

## **What does it do?**

The outlook system allows you and all other students and staff to communicate with each other professionally as well as communicating with potential placement collegues. It is a common system used in most workplaces as it is very easy to use and adapt to. This makes it easier and more coordinated when finding out what needs to be done between staff and students, as well as keeping up to date with work during placements. Students can use it to ask tutors or other staff for help with work or revision and staff are then able to properly communicate to make sure they are working at a good standard whilst also providing support when necessary.

## **How does my email work?**

Microsoft outlook is a program designed for sending and reciving messages via email on their devices. People are able to save contacts or phone numbers of other collegues or friends making it easier to stay in contact if you do not have access to your email. You can also manage dates and times via the calender and filter emails through the junk area or the normal inbox, to get rid of any unwanted emails. You can save drafts of emails so if you dont have time to finnish them or havent figured out what you want to add, you can save a copy of that email which will be autmatically put into the drafts section. There is a notes section so you can write any improtant notes you may need later on rather than writing it on paper or creating a whole document for a couple of words. You are also able to view emails you have sent or emails you have recieved and forward them to other collegues or filter between them to find any emails you may want to download or delete. The "My Email" link on the college portal directs you to your college account and automatically signs you in so its easier to get straight to any emails or messages you need to find. You can track tasks and set yourself tasks to make management of work easier if necessary, this allows for a more professional and more efficient work standard.
